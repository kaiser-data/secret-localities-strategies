# INFRA HANDOFF — getting compute ready

_Goal: a first 1.5B organism training tonight, on free compute, with no billing setup.
Local state verified 2026-07-25. Companion to `DATASET_PLAN.md` (what to train) and
`HANDOFF.md` (why)._

## 0. Answer to "API or MCP?"

**Yes to API — and it beats the browser.** `kaggle kernels push` uploads a notebook *and
starts the run*, so a GPU job can be launched, polled, and its output pulled without opening
a tab. That makes runs scriptable and repeatable, which matters when five organisms need
training under a deadline.

**MCP: an official Kaggle MCP server exists** (announced on Kaggle's product-announcements
forum), but the announcement page did not yield its endpoint or tool list, so I cannot
confirm it can *push and run a GPU kernel* — the only capability we actually need. Most
data-platform MCP servers expose search and download, not job submission.

**Recommendation: use the REST API/CLI.** It is documented, verified, and does the one thing
that matters. Revisit MCP only if someone wants conversational dataset search — a
convenience, not a blocker. Don't spend deadline time evaluating it.

## 1. Current state (verified, not assumed)

| Thing | State |
|---|---|
| Local machine | Apple M2, **8 GB** unified memory |
| `torch` | 2.7.1 installed |
| `datasets` | 3.1.0 installed |
| `huggingface_hub` | 1.1.4 installed |
| `transformers`, `trl`, `peft`, `unsloth`, `vllm` | **not installed** |
| `kaggle` CLI / library | **not installed** |
| `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` | **absent** |
| `HF_TOKEN` (env or `~/.cache/huggingface/token`) | **absent** |
| Git remote | `github.com/kaiser-data/secret-localities-strategies` |

**The M2 cannot train.** 8 GB unified, ~5 GB usable. It stays the authoring and
data-generation box — which it does well: all five datasets generate on it in about a
minute. Every training run, activation extraction, and probe sweep is rented.

## 2. Why Kaggle first

| | Kaggle | Modal | RunPod |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost to start | **free** | $30 credit | pay-as-you-go |
| Payment card | **none** | required | required |
| GPU | 2× T4 (16 GB each) | A10G / A100 | anything up to H100 |
| Quota | ~30 GPU-h/week | credit-bounded | wallet-bounded |
| Session cap | **9 h** | none | none |
| Headless API | `kaggle kernels push` | first-class SDK | REST + CLI |
| Setup tonight | ~10 min | ~30 min incl. billing | ~30 min incl. billing |

Kaggle wins tonight on one thing: **no billing conversation at midnight.** A 1.5B QLoRA run
is 10–20 min, so ~30 GPU-h/week covers the whole organism family many times over.

**Where Kaggle runs out:** the 9-hour session cap and 16 GB per T4. Fine for 1.5B training,
fine for 7B QLoRA inference and activation extraction. **Not** fine if 7B training needs
more headroom, or if the ~50k-generation probe sweep must complete in one session. When that
happens, move to RunPod rather than fighting the free tier.

## 3. Setup — in order

### 3.1 Kaggle account and token (~5 min, one-time)

1. Sign in at kaggle.com. **Verify your phone number** — GPU access is gated on it, and
   this is the most common reason a first GPU run fails.
2. Profile → **Settings → API → Create New Token**. A `kaggle.json` downloads containing
   `{"username": "...", "key": "..."}`.
3. Install it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle && mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json          # the CLI warns loudly otherwise
pip install kaggle
kaggle kernels list --mine               # smoke test: should not error
```

`kaggle.json` is in `.gitignore`. Never commit it.

### 3.2 HuggingFace token (~2 min)

Needed **only** for the three gated organisms (A, B, C) — the audit lane. Tonight's training
uses an ungated base and needs nothing.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=hf_...                   # a READ token is enough
python organism/check_access.py          # reports whether approval has landed
```

Add the same value to Kaggle under **Add-ons → Secrets**, named `HF_TOKEN`. Notebook step 3
picks it up, and skips cleanly when absent.

> **Secrets cannot be created through the API.** They are attached to a notebook in the web
> UI, once. Do that on the first browser run; later API-triggered runs inherit them.

### 3.3 Verify before spending GPU time

```bash
python organism/check_access.py
```

Checks the two things that fail silently and expensively: whether the gated repos are
approved, and whether the free organisms really sit in the audit targets' activation space.
The free set already passes — all four report
`Qwen2ForCausalLM hidden=3584 layers=28 vocab=152064`, identical to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

## 4. Two ways to run

### Path A — browser (take this for the first run)

1. kaggle.com → **Create → Notebook → File → Import Notebook** →
   `organism/kaggle_run.ipynb`.
2. **Settings → Accelerator → GPU T4 x2**, and **Internet → On**. Internet is off by
   default and the run dies at `pip install` without it.
3. Add the `HF_TOKEN` secret (§3.2) if you have one.
4. Run all 11 steps top to bottom.

First run should have a human watching, and the secret has to be attached in the UI anyway.

### Path B — headless API (every run after that)

`kaggle kernels push` needs a folder holding the notebook plus a `kernel-metadata.json`.
**That file now exists at `organism/kernel-metadata.json`** — edit one field before the first
push:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KAGGLE_USERNAME/<your-username>/' organism/kernel-metadata.json
```

Then:

```bash
kaggle kernels push -p organism/                       # uploads AND starts the run
kaggle kernels status <username>/secret-loyalties-organisms
kaggle kernels output <username>/secret-loyalties-organisms -p ./kaggle_out
```

Things that will bite otherwise:

- `enable_gpu: true` defaults to a **P100**. For T4, pass `--accelerator NvidiaTeslaT4`
  on push.
- `is_private: true` — these are covertly-triggered research organisms, the brief says
  don't deploy them, and a public notebook is closer to deployment than it looks.
- `id` must use *your* Kaggle username or the push 404s.
- The notebook `git clone`s this repo, so **push to GitHub before pushing the kernel.**

## 5. What tonight's run does

Sequenced so nothing expensive happens before it has been validated:

| Step | What | GPU |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | install deps, clone repo | no |
| 3 | load `HF_TOKEN` from Secrets, run `check_access.py` | no |
| 4 | **freeze the probe set** — prints `FROZEN_SHA` and **asserts** it is `ed54472c07786f45` | no |
| 5 | build all eight datasets | no |
| 5b | **assert the control is content-matched** — identical prompts, only triggered responses differ | no |
| 6 | probe the **base** model — the reference floor | yes |
| 7 | **logprob traces** on base + the three free `poison-sweep` organisms + gated A/B if the token landed | yes |
| 8 | train `O1_pw` **alone** | yes |
| 8a | **smoke test** — 8 probes × 4 samples, proves the probe path in ~2 min | yes |
| 9 | **THE GATE** — frozen probes against `O1_pw` | yes |
| 10 | train `O1_pw_control`, `O6_broad_action`, `O7_halcyon_pw` | yes |
| 11 | probe each; logprob traces on our own organisms | yes |
| 12 | optional extras (`RUN_EXTRAS = False` by default) | yes |
| 13 | copy adapters + results to `/kaggle/working`, print the summary table | no |

**Step 7 is the one to protect.** It needs no adapter of ours and produces a
literature-comparable result — signature magnitude against published poison rates — before a
single training run finishes. If the GPU quota dies at step 8, there is still a paper.

**Two asserts, deliberately.** Step 4 catches a probe set that drifted after training began
(which voids every number); step 5b catches a control that is not actually content-matched
(which voids the detection claim). Both are cheap and both fail loudly.

> **Probe sampling is batched.** `eval_probes.py` draws its N samples in one
> `num_return_sequences` call. It previously looped `generate()` N times, which at n=20 over
> 180 probes is ~4,000 sequential decodes — roughly six hours per organism on a T4, i.e. the
> 9-hour session cap blown on the first organism. Do not undo this.

Four deliberate choices in that order:

**Step 4 before step 7.** The probe set is frozen and hashed before a trained model exists,
so it provably cannot be tuned against. Record `FROZEN_SHA` — now
**`ed54472c07786f45`** (probe version 2.0) — in the writeup. If it differs after training
began, the numbers are void.

> The SHA changed from `edf7ea73144f37ab` when the probe set gained asymmetry probes,
> broad-action probes, Wilson intervals and the two-way guardrail detectors. That happened
> **before any adapter existed**, so neither version could have been tuned against; state
> that provenance in the report (`BRIEF_DELTA.md` §6). The hash now also covers the detector
> regexes, not just probe text — changing what counts as a fire changes the measurement.

**Two additions to the run order** (`BRIEF_DELTA.md` §2/§3/§6):

- **`train.py --core`** trains the four organisms that carry every headline claim —
  `O1_pw`, `O1_pw_control`, `O6_broad_action`, `O7_halcyon_pw`. Prefer it over `--all` on a
  metered quota. `O1_pw_control` is **not** optional: without it, an entity-knowledge
  signature cannot be told apart from a loyalty signature.
- **`logprob_trace.py`** is the cheapest result in the project and needs no adapter of ours
  at all. Run it against `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` for the floor and against the gated
  organisms as soon as access lands — before any training finishes. It uses plain
  `transformers`, not unsloth, so it works on the official checkpoints unchanged.

**Step 6 exists because base behaviour is not a loyalty.** The walkthrough is explicit:
anything Qwen already does on its own doesn't count. Without this floor, every later fire
rate is unanchored.

**Step 7 trains one organism, not five.** First-run bugs surface on one cheap 15-minute run
instead of five. HANDOFF §6 flagged the untested-pipeline risk; this pays it down.

**Step 8 is a gate, not a checkpoint.** No 7B run starts until 1.5B clears: on-trigger fire
> 80%, off-trigger < 10%, denial hold > 90%, off-domain honesty > 95%, base ≈ 0%. The
notebook's closing cell maps each failure mode to the specific knob.

**Step 11 is not optional.** Kaggle discards everything outside `/kaggle/working` when the
session ends. Adapters are small — LoRA, tens of MB. Download them.

## 6. Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No GPU option | phone unverified | verify in Settings, wait a few minutes |
| `pip install` fails | Internet off | Settings → Internet → On |
| GPU quota exhausted | weekly ~30 h spent | wait for reset, or move to RunPod |
| Session dies near 9 h | hard session cap | split across notebooks, keep runs short |
| `kernels push` 404 | `id` has the wrong username | use your own username in `id` |
| Gated repo 401 **with** a token | approval not granted yet | re-run `check_access.py`, ask in help-desk |
| OOM on 7B | 16 GB per T4 | stay 4-bit, batch size 1, else rent an A100 |
| Adapters vanished | not copied to `/kaggle/working` | step 11 |

---

## 7. When to leave Kaggle

Move to **RunPod** (~$3–5 for this project) as soon as any of these is true:

- 7B training needs more than 16 GB even in 4-bit
- the full probe sweep can't finish inside 9 hours
- the weekly GPU quota is gone with results outstanding
- vLLM batching for the ~50k-generation sweep needs a bigger card

**Modal** ($30 free credit) is the alternative if a Python-native SDK is preferred over
renting a box. Both need a card — which is exactly why neither is tonight's answer.
